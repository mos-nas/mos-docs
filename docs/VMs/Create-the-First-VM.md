# 🖥️ Create the First VM

MOS supports running full virtual machines (VMs) using KVM/QEMU.  
This guide walks you through creating and configuring your first VM.

:::warning **Prerequisite:**
Before you can create a VM, you must first enable the **VM Service** in the settings. Navigate to **Settings → Virtualization → VM Service** and enable the service. For more details, refer to the [VM Service](../Virtualization/VM-Service.md) documentation.

Additionally, it is recommended to set a network interface to **bridged** mode for optimal VM service functionality. For more information, refer to the [Network Configuration](../Quick-Start/Start-Network-Configuration.md#bridged-recommended) documentation.

### 🏷️ Name

The unique name for your VM as it appears in the overview.

**Best practices:**
- Use short, descriptive names
- Avoid spaces and special characters

---

### 🧠 Memory Size (GB)

Defines how much RAM is allocated to the VM.

Use the slider to set the desired memory size in GB.

:::note
Only allocate as much memory as the VM actually needs to avoid starving the host system.

:::

---

## 🪟 VirtIO Drivers

For Windows VMs, VirtIO drivers are required to use `virtio` disks and network adapters.

Select the **VirtIO ISO** from the dropdown to attach the driver disk.

:::note
The VirtIO ISO must be downloaded and placed on the system beforehand. It provides drivers for disk controllers, network adapters, and more inside Windows VMs.
:::

- GPU passthrough for gaming VMs
- Dedicated network card passthrough
- NVMe/storage controller passthrough

---
